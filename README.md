# Text-Based-Adventure_Quiz-Game
A Text-Based Adventure Game is a type of game in which a player has to make choices (Yes / No) in every step of the game.
Based on these choices, the storyline changes, and at last, we get to know that whether the player wins or loses the game.

# Understanding the Code Above
In the first line of this code, we have used the List Variable for storing all the combinations of saying Yes.

Similarly, In the second line of this code, we have used another List Variable to store all the combinations of saying No.

In the next line, we have printed the intro of our game. Then we asked the user to type Yes or No with the help of input() in Python.

So, if the user type Yes, then the code inside the if block will get executed.

On the other hand, if the user type No, then the code inside the elif block will get executed.

At last, if the user types some wrong input, then the code inside the else block will get executed.
